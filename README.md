## Key Features

- 12 Exercise Routine: Fit in 7 offers a curated set of 12 exercises that target various muscle groups and provide a well-rounded workout experience.

- Timer with Voice Guidance: Each exercise is timed precisely for 30 seconds, and you'll receive voice guidance through Text-to-Speech (TTS) to notify you about the name of the next exercise and when to start and end each exercise. After every exercise, a 10-second break is provided for you to catch your breath and get ready for the next challenge.
